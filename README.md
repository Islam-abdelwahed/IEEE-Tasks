**University:** Zagazig University  
**Department:** Electrical Engineering / Electronics  
**Phase:** Introductory Phase 1 (2023/2024)  

Welcome to my collection of tasks and projects from the IEEE Student Branch RAS Committee! This repository documents my journey through electronics fundamentals, circuit design, simulation with Proteus, and introductory Python programming. Each task builds on the previous, culminating in a team-based final project.

🌟 **Highlights:**  
- Explored core electronics: Power supplies, transistors, op-amps, timers, and sensors.  
- Gained hands-on experience with Proteus simulations and hardware prototypes.  
- Collaborated on a group project with Phoenix Team (Group E).  
- Total Tasks: 5 individual + 1 Python + 1 Final Project.  
- Key Skills: Circuit design, debugging, video explanations, and teamwork.
